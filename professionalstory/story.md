I originally became a civil engineer because I was drawn to problem solving. I
also enjoyed building things that are useful. Civil engineering satisfied this
desire. Especially when I was in school and learning all the math and science that
goes into our infrastructure.

After a few years in the industry I started to become bored. A lot of the work
I did was based off previous projects that had similar projects. I didn't feel
like I was getting the problem solving I wanted. Instead I felt like I was doing
more CAD (computer assisted drafting) than engineering.

So I decided to try out coding based on a friend's recommendation. I fell in love
with it. Coding gave me an outlet to problem and solve and be creative.
